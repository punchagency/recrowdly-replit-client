Identified clarifying questions to refine comprehensive app prompt.



Field Agent App - Clarifying Questions
This is a robust concept! Before I build out a comprehensive Replit prompt, I need to understand a few things better to make sure the prompt captures your vision accurately:

Core Business Questions
What are the field agents selling/providing? Is this B2B sales for a specific product/service (solar, telecom, insurance, etc.), or is this a platform that could be white-labeled for different industries?
What does "go live" toggle do exactly? Does it show the agent as available for new appointments, or does it activate GPS tracking, or both?
"Interoperates with desktop app" - Is there an existing desktop system this needs to connect to? What data needs to sync?
Who books the appointments? Does the call center schedule them, do businesses self-book, or does the agent prospect and book themselves?
Technical Scope Questions
Target platforms? Mobile-first (React Native/Flutter for iOS + Android), or web app that's mobile-responsive?
Zoom integration - Should the app launch native Zoom, or embed video calling within the app itself?
Background check provider preference? (Checkr, Sterling, etc.) or build integration flexibility?
Payment rails for rep earnings? Stripe Connect, direct ACH, or integration with existing payroll?
Naming & Branding
Does this app have a name yet? Or should I leave that as a placeholder?
Who is "Gus" referenced in training materials?
B2B sales for AI automation and AI vibe coding services
opportunities become available after telesales team has called in
it needs to interoperate with a web app that the telesales team is using to book field appointments
call center schedules, agent can prospect and book themselves
whatever makes most sense for a prototype but can easily convert to an ios and android native app
WebRTC integratoin
generic open source one to start
stripe connect


Synthesized requirements and identified clarification gaps.



Great answers! A few more quick clarifications before I build this out:

Final Questions
App name? Should I use a placeholder like [APP_NAME] or do you have something in mind?
Who is "Gus"? You mentioned "Gus training material has to be great" - is this a person, a mascot, or a typo?
The web app for telesales - does this already exist, or are we building both the field agent mobile app AND the telesales web app as part of this project?
AI enrichment sources - for the "auto enrich with AI" feature (company context, suggested talking points, sales packages), should this pull from:
Public data (LinkedIn, company websites, news)?
Internal CRM data from the telesales web app?
Both?
Admin dashboard - who needs to:
Review/approve rep applications (KYC)?
Post job listings?
View rep performance/earnings?
Manage territories/routing?
Is this the same telesales web app, or a separate admin portal?
Lead source for self-prospecting - when agents prospect themselves, do they:
See a map of businesses in their area?
Get a list from the system?
Manually enter leads they find?
app is called Recrowdly


Acknowledged app name, identified remaining clarifying questions.


Got it - Recrowdly.

Still need answers on these to build you a tight prompt:

Who is "Gus"? (You mentioned "Gus training material has to be great")
Telesales web app - already exists, or building both systems together?
AI enrichment - pull from public data (LinkedIn, websites), internal CRM data, or both?
Admin functions (reviewing applicants, posting jobs, managing territories) - separate admin portal, or built into the telesales web app?
Self-prospecting leads - agents see a map of nearby businesses, get system-generated lists, or manually enter their own?
Gus is the current field rep
telesales app already exists

Synthesized user responses and identified remaining clarifications needed.



Got it - Gus is your star rep whose methods become the training foundation. And we're building Recrowdly to integrate with the existing telesales system.

Three more and I'll have everything:

AI enrichment sources - should the meeting context/talking points pull from:
Public data only (LinkedIn, company websites, news)?
Internal data from the existing telesales app (call notes, previous interactions)?
Both?
Admin portal - should reviewing applicants, posting jobs, and viewing rep performance be:
A separate admin dashboard we're building?
Added into the existing telesales web app?
Self-prospecting - when agents find their own leads, do they:
See a map of nearby businesses to cold-call?
Get system-suggested leads?
Manually enter businesses they discover?
AI enchriment is need and Sokol
built into the telesales web app
all of the above, their is an incentive for cold calling places not in the database already by visiting

Deciphered user requirements and identified clarification needed.



Almost there - one clarification:

What is "Sokol"? Is this:

An internal tool/system you already use?
A third-party API or data provider?
A typo (maybe "social")?
Once I know this, I'll build out the full Replit prompt for Recrowdly.

A third-party API or data provider?

Other functionality

booking calendar integrated in app - rolls up to internal visibility across all reps 8:31
CRM app and/or field all - way for appointment setter to flag phone numbers that don't work to send back to lead gen team
Warm leads that aren't responsive get added to a follow up queue
Verdi Ergün  8:12 PM
Warm leads that are not interested get added to a follow up queue  (edited) 
Verdi Ergün  8:46 PM
10 to 15 new leads a day, we specialize in getting high value customers like root canals etc
8:50
3 actors:
* appointment setter
* Gig economy
* Consultative sales
Record the consultative sales calls, turn them into highly personalized email text and phone campaigns (I remember you said you wanted more sales, we just added a model that does that, here's my calendar to book, I'll be in your neighborhood on Tuesday )
8:50
* the gig economy people should know that they are going to meet resistance (no appointment scheduled, doctor isn't in, etc) with how they handle those situations

Synthesized multi-actor sales system with integrated CRM and campaign automation.


This context is really helpful - I'm seeing the full picture now. Let me confirm I understand the ecosystem:

The Three Actors
Role	Tool	Function
Appointment Setter	Existing telesales web app	Cold calls leads, books appointments for field reps
Gig Economy Field Rep	Recrowdly (what we're building)	Shows up to appointments, handles resistance, warms the lead
Consultative Sales Closer	?	Does the actual close (Zoom or in-person), earns the $1,000
Clarifying Questions
Is the "consultative sales closer" a separate person from the gig economy field rep? Or can a field rep graduate to doing closes themselves?
The $1,000 close bonus - does this go to:
The field rep who warmed the lead?
The consultative closer who sealed it?
Split between them?
Recording consultative calls → personalized campaigns - is this automated AI follow-up, or does it feed a human to execute?
Target vertical - you mentioned dental (root canals). Is Recrowdly specifically for selling AI services to dental practices, or is dental just one example vertical?
Resistance training - do you want this as:
Video content from Gus?
Interactive scenarios/roleplay?
AI-powered objection handling coach?
separate person
field rep

Clarified role distinctions and identified remaining questions.



Got it - so the field rep earns $1,000 when their warmed lead eventually closes, even though someone else does the actual close. That's a strong incentive structure.

Three more to nail this down:

Recording consultative calls → personalized follow-up campaigns - should this be:
Fully automated (AI generates and sends emails/texts)?
AI drafts, human reviews and sends?
AI drafts, feeds back to appointment setters to execute?
Target vertical - is Recrowdly built specifically for dental practices, or is dental one example and the platform should be industry-agnostic?
Resistance training for field reps (handling "no appointment scheduled," "doctor isn't in," etc.) - preferred format:
Video library from Gus showing how he handles these?
Interactive scenario simulations?
AI coach that roleplays objections?
All of the above?
AI follow-up to prepare, human to hit send
dental, lawyer, businesses that need leads and operational improvements
vidoe content, roleplay objection handling coaching

Synthesized comprehensive gig-economy app architecture with AI enrichment.

UI/UX Guidelines
Design Principles
Mobile-first, thumb-friendly
High contrast for outdoor visibility
Large tap targets for on-the-go use
Minimal typing required (voice input where possible)
Earnings always visible (motivation)
Color Scheme
Primary: Energetic, motivational (suggest orange or green)
Earnings: Always in green
Alerts/urgency: Red/orange
Success states: Green checks
Key Screens (Priority Order)
Home Dashboard
Appointment Detail with AI Enrichment
Route Planning Map
Check-In Flow
Earnings Dashboard
Training Center
Application/Onboarding Flow
MVP Scope (Phase 1)
Build these first:

✅ Application flow with KYC
✅ Home dashboard with Go Live toggle
✅ Appointment list and detail views
✅ Geolocation check-in/check-out
✅ Basic route planning
✅ Earnings tracking
✅ Push notifications
✅ API endpoints for telesales integration
Phase 2
AI enrichment (Sokol + OpenAI)
WebRTC video calls
Recording and transcription
AI follow-up generation
Training center with roleplay
Phase 3
Referral system
Advanced analytics
Native app conversion (React Native)
Additional Context
Target Verticals
Dental practices (high-value procedures like root canals)
Law firms
Any business needing leads and operational improvements
The Three Actors in the Sales Pipeline
Role	Tool	Function
Appointment Setter	Existing telesales web app	Cold calls leads, books field appointments
Gig Economy Field Rep	Recrowdly (this app)	Shows up, warms leads, handles resistance
Consultative Closer	Separate system	Closes the deal via Zoom/in-person
Key Training Focus
Reps will encounter resistance (no appointment scheduled, decision maker unavailable, etc.). Training content from Gus (top performing rep) should address:

Video walkthroughs of common objections
AI-powered roleplay scenarios
Script templates and talking points
Lead Flow
Lead gen team sources leads
Appointment setter calls and books
Field rep shows up, warms lead
If hot → Consultative closer takes over
Field rep earns $1,000 when lead closes (even though closer did final sale)
Follow-Up System
AI analyzes consultation recordings
Generates personalized email/text drafts
Human reviews and hits send
Example: "I remember you said you wanted more root canal patients - we just added a model for that. I'll be in your neighborhood Tuesday."
